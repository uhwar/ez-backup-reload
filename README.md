# Game Save Backup Utility

A Python utility that automatically locates and backs up game save files from various PC games to a local "loaded saves" directory.

## Features

- Scans PC for game save files across multiple game titles and platforms
- Supports common game save locations (Steam, Epic, GOG, Documents, AppData, etc.)
- Identifies save files by common patterns and file extensions
- Backs up saves to local "loaded saves" directory organized by game
- Handles multiple game titles and save formats
- Non-destructive operations - never modifies original saves

# Double-click or run from command line:

```

OR

```powershell

BackUp-Interface.bat

# Method 2: PowerShell script
.\launch_gui.ps1

# Method 3: Manual
cd ui
npm start
```

### Command Line Interface

#### Basic Usage

```

## Troubleshooting

### GUI won't launch
- **Node.js not found**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- **Python not found**: Install Python from https://python.org/
- **Dependencies missing**: Run `npm install` in the `ui/` directory
- **Permission errors**: Run PowerShell as Administrator

### Common Issues
- **"electron not found"**: Delete `ui/node_modules/` and run `npm install` again
- **White screen**: Dependencies may be corrupted, try reinstalling with `npm install`
- **Python script fails**: Ensure Python is in your PATH and accessible via `py` command
